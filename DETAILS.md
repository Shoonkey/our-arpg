# Details

These are the details of what will be implemented.

Original brainstorms are [here](./Brainstorms/). This is what we came up with based on the brainstorms.

- Technology advances and tries to take control over nature
- Cliffs could turn into enemies
- Cables with red energy, like in Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood
- Nature has a mix of tech in it, so it's metalized and organic
- Effects on the technology in colors like purple, lightblue, dark red
- Scenario is partly corrupted, consumed by the tech controlled by an AI
- The scientist behind the AI is the main character. He regrets creating the AI and wants to control the chaos it has spread. He has a bionic arm that holds the power the AI had at the moment of creation, but the AI has spread and learned with nature. Along the path, he collects data about what the AI has learned and enhances his powers.
  - AI replicates natural forms, using origami
    - A head of a lion, that can roar
    - Vines
  - Bosses are manifestations of the AI, that were created to help the AI spread. Looking at nature and trying to imitate it, the AI spread first through the pollen, then insects, then reptiles and amphibians, then fish, then birds and land animals. Each evolution may be represented by a boss, that represents a mean the AI has already mastered.
  - His experiments were limited by the data he could collect in the lab. Nature is vast and adapts to the environment, so for the AI to really learn about how to connect with nature it needs a lot of data: the most mutations it could find. He is willing to give it the data it needs, and for that he embeds the tech in nano-robots that act like pollen, and he spreads them over a field. From there, the robots will hack into the plants to spread and create more of them, and will spread along with normal pollen, through the wind and insects like bees.
